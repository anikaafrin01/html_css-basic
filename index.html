		<h1>Why do we use it?</h1>

		<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be <strong>distracted</strong>by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like <strong>readable English.</strong> Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text</p>
